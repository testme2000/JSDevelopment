        Documenting my trip around USA on my very own Segway, 1 mile at a time

        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID,
        Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ, and Truth and Consequences, NM.

        I saw Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May
        get you, A glimpse, of eternity." I definitely won't be passing  any cars.

        My first day of the trip!. I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I’m on a Segway,
        I wasn’t able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod,
        digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, “A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one Segway.”
